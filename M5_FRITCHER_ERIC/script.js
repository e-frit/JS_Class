/* Part 1: Build Arrays

Create an array that includes four different colors as strings */
colorStringArray = ["red", "orange", "yellow", "green"];

// Create an array with five different foods as strings
foodStringArray = ["pizza", "salad", "bacon", "pasta", "fruit"];

// Create an array with six different animals as strings
animalStringArray = ["cat","bat","dog","monkey","fish","bird"];

// Create an array with all even numbers from 0 â€“ 20.
evenNumberArray = [0, 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 14, 16, 18, 20];

    let textToAdd = inputArray
    let newDiv = document.createElement("div")

/* Part 2: Array Methods

Use the toString method to have all of the colors write to the HTML */
divTextInjector(colorStringArray.toString());

// Use the join method to have all of the colors write to the HTML with a separator
divTextInjector(colorStringArray.join(", "));

// Use the pop method on the animals array and have the array log to the console
animalStringArray.pop();
console.log(animalStringArray);

// Use the push method to add a new animal to the animal array and have the array write to the HTML.
animalStringArray.push("turtle");
divTextInjector(animalStringArray.join(", "));

// Use the splice method to add three new foods to the food array. Have this write to the HTML.
foodStringArray.splice(0, 0, "eggs", "cake", "bread");
divTextInjector(foodStringArray.join(", "));

// Use the slice method to move the 2nd, 3rd, and 4th foods into their own array. Have this write to the HTML.
foodSubArray = foodStringArray.slice(1,4);
divTextInjector(foodSubArray.join(", "));

// Part 3: Array Sort and Iteration

// Use the sort method on the numbers array. Remember you will need a compare function to do so. Have this log to the console.
console.log(evenNumberArray.sort(function(a, b) {return a-b}));

// Use the filter method on the numbers array to create a new array with all numbers higher than 10. Have this log to the console.
console.log(evenNumberArray.filter(function over10(i){return i > 10}));

// Use the find method on the numbers array to find the first element that is greater than 12. Have this log to the console.
console.log(evenNumberArray.find(function over12(i){return i > 12}));

// Use the every method on the numbers array to check if the elements are greater than 8. Have this log to the console.
console.log(evenNumberArray.every(function allOver8(i){return i > 8}));

// Use the some method on the numbers array to check if the elements are greater than 8. Have this log to the console.
console.log(evenNumberArray.some(function someOver8(i){return i > 8}))
